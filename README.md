# Websites Developed using MERN Stack

These websites are dear to me, and I don't want to share my secret recipe :)

Instead, I've linked them below to feast with the eyes:
* [HelloFreshers](https://hello-freshers.herokuapp.com/) - A refreshed website built for my Alma-mater, however it didn't go through due to some administrative decisions by higher authorities/conflict of interests.
* [NiceFunnyGifts](https://nicefunnygifts.com) - Gifting made simple.
* [HireBest]() - A landing page I made for my startup idea.
