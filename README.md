# Websites Developed using MERN Stack

While I'd love to upload the code of my websites, these websites are dear to me. Instead, I've linked them below to feast with the eyes:
* HelloFreshers - A refreshed website built for my Alma-mater, however it didn't go through due to some administrative decisions by higher authorities/conflict of interests.
* NiceFunnyGifts - Gifting made simple.
* HireBest - A landing page I made for my startup idea.
